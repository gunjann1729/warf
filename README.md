> :warning: Since Heroku apps run in a lightweight container called dynos, so any changes to the filesystem while the dyno is running only last until that dyno is shut down or restarted. This operation causes the saved scan results to get deleted from the server and hence you won't be able to see the saved results. Due to this limitation of file storage, the live version of app deployed in Heroku is not stable and might throw errors while performing some operations.

## About WARF
<p>WARF is a Recon framework for the web application. It comprises different tools to perform information gathering on the target such as subdomain enumeration, directory Bruteforce, gathering all sorts of endpoints like Wayback URLs, JS URLs, endpoints from JS files, API/Secret keys, etc.</p>
<p>WARF is highly customizable and allows you to perform a full scan or individual scan on the target. It accumulates the results and shows them in a powerful DataTable through which you can narrow down your searches. WARF also give you the option to add and save target individually and perform different scans on them. </p>
<p>With a Dashboard, you will quickly get the metrics of your activity. WARF confined all your targets together and provide you with a clean and efficient way to search them down with their names.</p>

### Main Features
- Subdomain Enumeration
- Directory BruteForce
- Gather Wayback URLs
- Gather JavaScript URLs
- Extract links from JS files
- Extract API/Secret Keys from JS files
- Supports Background Scan
